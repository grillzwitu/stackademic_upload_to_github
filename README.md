## Uploading to GitHub
This is a simple project that entails creating 3 files;
-  __index.html__
-  __style.css__ 
- __script.js__ 

The 3 files are linked, and most importantly the repository should be created and uploaded to github.

I've added some personal touches by adding some content and functionality to the page. I added an alert when the button on the page is clicked and a change in the page background color after the alert is cleared.
